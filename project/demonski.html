            <p>
                Demonski, my inaugural game programming venture, is a 2D platformer created using 
                Unity Engine. Serving as a learning project, it features a robust set of elements, 
                including a settings menu, loading screens, and a dynamic character with jump, crouch, 
                and attack functionalities. The game introduces adversaries with similar attack 
                capabilities, engaging players in scripted dialogues. Set amidst floating islands 
                with dynamic movements, Demonski challenges players to master parkour skills. This 
                project not only marked my introduction to game programming but also highlighted 
                the versatility of Unity Engine in bringing dynamic features to life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Expanding on the code sample, this was my first attempt at programming a system in which
                it had to decide wether to attack, and how it should act when doing so. I understand that
                it lacks comments as does alot of the project but back then I wasn't quite aware of the 
                importance of doing so.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the player's capabilities, Demonski introduces engaging adversaries with attack 
                mechanisms akin to the player's, creating a challenging environment. The inclusion of 
                scripted dialogue adds depth to the player's interactions with these foes, enriching the 
                gaming experience. The game's setting unfolds across floating islands, each with dynamic 
                movements—some ascending, others descending. Navigating through these islands demands a 
                mastery of parkour skills, adding an exciting layer to the gameplay.
            </p>
            <p>
                By choosing Unity Engine for Demonski, I continued to leverage its robust capabilities, 
                and this project became a testament to my evolving proficiency in game development. The 
                blend of learning and creative implementation in Demonski underlines the versatile 
                possibilities within the Unity environment and marks a significant milestone in my 
                journey as a game developer.
