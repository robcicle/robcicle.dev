            <p>
                Mooney's Cave Crusader, a first-year university project, was a collaborative 
                effort involving two designers, two artists, and myself as the sole programmer. 
                Leveraging Unity Engine and programmed in C#, the game unfolded within a dynamic 
                2D environment. Unity's versatility allowed us to seamlessly integrate visual 
                elements, while C# facilitated efficient and modular coding. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Just touching a little bit about the code sample, this was the Class for scrolling 
                the tracks throughout the screen, this was needed as theoretically it could just go 
                forever and the Engine has it's limitations so I decided to create a system where 
                the tracks would actually be the ones moving and then once off screen they would 
                go around again that way the whole scene itself never actually moves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the development process, we embraced a structured approach to 
                enhance our efficiency and cohesion. Weekly SCRUM meetings became a 
                cornerstone of our methodology, providing a platform for in-depth discussions 
                on game concepts, mechanics, and various project-related aspects. This 
                consistent communication fostered a collaborative environment, ensuring 
                that everyone was on the same page and contributing their unique expertise 
                to the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to SCRUM meetings, we utilized tools such as Trello boards and 
                group chats to streamline our workflow. These platforms proved invaluable 
                in organizing tasks, tracking progress, and facilitating real-time 
                communication. The synergy between SCRUM meetings, Trello boards, and 
                group chats played a pivotal role in not only meeting but surpassing our 
                project milestones, allowing us to deliver a polished game prototype within 
                the designated timeframe.
            </p>
            <p>
                The satisfaction derived from the project extended beyond its timely 
                completion. The final product was not only a testament to our collective 
                dedication but also a source of pride. Witnessing the transformation of 
                individual contributions into a cohesive and engaging game prototype 
                reinforced the value of effective collaboration in achieving shared goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mooney's Cave Crusader was, above all, an enjoyable and enriching venture 
                that not only honed my technical skills as a programmer but also broadened
                 my perspective on the importance of teamwork and reliability in achieving 
                 success within a group setting. This experience laid a solid foundation for 
                 future collaborative endeavors and left an indelible mark on my understanding 
                 of the intricacies involved in game development and project management.
